> A collection of quality of life functions and scripts for Power Query.

Project folder setup is mirrored as much as possible from the [Power Query function reference site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/power-query-m-function-reference), so you can feel at home navigating the structure.

> **DISCLAIMER** Some of the functions are not authored directly by me, when this happens I try to make sure its original author and a link to where I found out about the technique is referenced in the function documentation.
